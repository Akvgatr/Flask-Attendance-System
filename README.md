### ðŸ§© Problem Statement
This project aims to address the limitations of traditional attendance systems, particularly the widespread issue of proxy attendance. It focuses on developing a more secure and reliable system by implementing a layered authentication mechanism that combines multiple verification methods. These layers make it significantly harder to spoof or manipulate attendance, thereby enhancing the overall integrity and trustworthiness of the system.

### ðŸš€ Motivation
Traditional attendance systems are inefficient and prone to manipulation.

Proxy attendance is common, even in multi-modal systems, using methods like images, audio recordings, or location spoofing.

The project uses multiple independent verification layers to prevent spoofing and enhance security.

These layers are hard to bypass simultaneously, increasing the reliability of the system.

The system ensures cross-platform compatibility, working seamlessly on PCs/laptops and Android/iOS devices.

### ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcome
Development of a Secure Multi-Modal Attendance System
Cross-Platform Compatibility
Real-Time Attendance Monitoring and Analytics


### Week 1:

1. Discussed the overall `architecture` of the system.
2. Researched about various methods to implement Geolocation verification, eg. using `HTML5 Brwoser API`, `Google Maps Geolocation API`,`ipify` and `ip-api`.
3. Studied various python libraries existing for speech verification like `Resemblyzer`.
4. Implemented demo Geolocation verification logic using `ipify`,`ip-api` and `HTML Browser API`.


### Week 2:
1. Implemented geolocation verification.
2. Implemented face recognition using opencv,cvzone,sklearn etc.
3. Added blink detection using cvzone for liveness check.


### Week 3:
1. Built the Frontend of the system using HTML,CSS,JavaScript.
2. Built the Backend using Flask.

### Week 4:
1. Improve the speech recognition part added phrase checking using speech_recognition.
2. Shifted from resemblyzer to librosa.
3. Improved face recognition by shifting to face_recognition library.


### Note : The project is still under continuous development, we are still engaged in improving AI authentication for better security.
